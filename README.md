3 days after failing for the GRE 2nd-round exam! come on baby!

hi,my dear friends.

I am so frustrated these days as mentioned above, so I have to do something for myself!

"Future" is such a gigantic topic, I almost dare not to face it, for those plans I've drew up in days before the 2nd-round exam were all collapsed!!! what a accident, what a joke...regulating? finding a job? I dont know what to do...

three and a half years, me, a student with poor gades in hydropower engineering. what a shit, fuck ur asshole，a interest ,or something called "不务正业的213" came up with me--->CODING, HAH! RIDICULOUS! should I stick to it? I dont know!!!

HAha,last night I remember that my 2nd-round test number is 404 "NOT FOUND!"...I am 24 this animal year, waht a coincidence!............

NO 2nd war,as a joke in these years!

PERFECT COLLEGE LIFE!
